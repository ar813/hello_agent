| `agents`                     | A toolbox for building AI agents.                            |

| `Runner`                     | Sends messages to the agent and gets replies.                |
| `AsyncOpenAI`                | Connects to the AI model online using an API key.            |
| `OpenAIChatCompletionsModel` | Tells the agent which model to use (like Gemini).            |

"""
ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of RunConfig in simple words:
RunConfig sets the rules and settings for how the agent should run and behave when it receives a message.

- It's like a settings box that tells the agent:
    - Which model to use,
    - Which provider (like OpenAI or Gemini),
    - Whether to turn on extra features like tracing
